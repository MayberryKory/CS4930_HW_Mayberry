NAME OF PROJECT: Encryption Using OpenSSL and AES
================

NAME OF PROGRAMMER: Kory Mayberry
===================


STATEMENT:
==========
I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.


SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
=====================


The files for this project can be found on github at:
or through the canvas turn in.


AES-OpenSSL_encrypt_decrypt_mayberry.py -- This is the main file
test.txt                                -- Contains the test cleartext input string
test_out.txt                            -- Contains the encrypted output of test.txt
test_out_decrypt                        -- Contains the decryption of the test_out.txt will match with test.txt


This program works best in a virtual environment To create a venv run
"python3 -m venv venv"
To run the virtual environment cd to the directory it is contained, then run
"source venv/bin/activate"
This will put your terminal within the virtual environment
Then install all packages in requirements.txt with
"pip install -r requirements.txt"
Then run
"python ./AES-OpenSSL_encrypt_decrypt_mayberry.py"

You will need some test files that have been included with the turn in
You can follow the script prompts to encrypt and decrypt and place the files for each at a path of your
choosing
